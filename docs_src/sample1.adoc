= Project Structure

* `/docs/` -- GitHub Pages static website, served from `docs` folder, and images source folder (if any).
** `.nojekyll` -- enforces static website (disables Jekyll).
** `index.html` -- converted HTML document.
* `/docs_src/` -- AsciiDoc sources.
** `*.adoc` -- sub-documents imported into `index.asciidoc`.
** `asciidoc-coalescer.rb` -- coalescer script to generate `../README.adoc` as a single AsciiDoc file.
** `index.asciidoc` -- main source document.
** `preview.html` -- converted HTML preview document (untracked).
** `warn-editing.txt` -- a "`don't edit me`" comment injected into output docs.
* `.editorconfig` -- {EditorConfig} settings for code styles consistency.
* `.gitattributes` -- _ad hoc_ Git settings.
* `.gitignore` -- _ad hoc_ Git settings.
* `.travis.yml` -- Travis CI configuration for testing build and code consistency.
* `git-hook-install.sh` -- install pre-commit Git hook to validate code styles consistency.
* `git-hook-remove.sh` -- uninstall pre-commit Git hook.
* `Rakefile` -- where all the build toolchain magic happens.
* `README.adoc` -- AsciiDoc sources coalesced into single README doc for GitHub previewing.
* `validate.sh` -- validates {EditorConfig} code styles consistency via {EClint}.
